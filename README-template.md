## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- [x] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- [x] See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (start the count at 14 days)
- [ ] **Bonus**: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle
  - I feel so close to completing this bonus objective. I made animations for this exact purpose and they look great. I just need to figure out a way to rig it up so that the animation plays at the right time. I'll get back to it another time.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

As I stated in the challenge section, I would like to continue working on this until I get the cards flipping properly. I already think I know how to do it, I just need to do it. Hopefully I can update this readme soon with the completion of that bonus objective.
